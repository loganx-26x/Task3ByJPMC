# JPMC Task 3
Task 3 of JPMC's Forage program has been successfully completed


Explanation:                                                                                                       
As we see, for trading analysis and to stock price monitor, given that traders have an enormous amount of information
and data on their UI environment, we have to give them several tools to make the trading task easier for them and to 
improve their performance so as to improve the company's revenue accordingly.

For this, I have generated a live graph that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way so that the 
traders can monitor and give their insights correspondingly. As from the last graph, I have added the ratio of two stocks 
and then added up a trigger event so that an alarm generates up whenever the upper and lower bounds are crossed.

This would really simplify the task a trader does, as the trigger event does its work of an alarm signal so the trader 
here mostly has to focus on how the graph upon the dashboard works up and with that improve the company's performance 
subsequently.
